# Introduction #

Unlike jQuery.html() that returns only the element's HTML content, jQuery.outerHTML() returns the selected element and its HTML content or replaces it as jQuery.replaceWith() method but with the difference that allows the replacing HTML to be inherit by the chaining. This version introduces support to replace a set of matched elements by DOM Elements and jQuery objects. It also introduces the support to .outerHTML( function ). Check Notes of the Version for more details.

For installing and examples, visit [the official page](http://darlesson.com/jquery/outerhtml/) or download the package.
